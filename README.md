# Tutorial Mode for Swift in the VS Code Extension

> 📝 A GSoC 2025 proposal proposed by me, now open-sourced for community inspiration and contribution.

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains my Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2025 proposal titled **"Tutorial Mode for Swift in the VS Code Extension"**. Although the mentoring organization wasn't selected and the project wasn't accepted, I’m sharing the full proposal publicly to encourage open-source collaboration, feedback, and potential future development.

The goal of this project was to create an interactive, beginner-friendly tutorial experience for learning the Swift programming language within the Visual Studio Code environment.

## 🚀 Project Idea

The proposed feature aims to:

- Integrate a **tutorial mode** directly within the [Swift VS Code extension](https://github.com/apple/swift-language).
- Help beginners learn Swift through step-by-step coding walkthroughs and guided CodeTour sequences.
- Support hands-on learning using real code examples from the Swift Book, DocC, swift-testing, and swift-format resources.

## 🧠 Key Features (Planned)

- Interactive walkthroughs for topics like:
  - Variables and Types
  - Functions and Control Flow
  - Optionals
  - Testing (using `swift-testing`)
  - Formatting (using `swift-format`)
- Built-in support using **VS Code Walkthrough API** or **CodeTour**.
- First-run setup or manual activation of tutorial mode.
- Community contribution model for new tutorials.
- Optional enhancements: progress tracking, achievements, and theming for accessibility.
